# API Testing Guide

## Overview
This project provides an API that you can test locally to explore its functionality. This guide will walk you through how to set up the environment and use **Postman** to test the API endpoints effectively.

## Prerequisites

- **Postman**: You will need Postman to interact with and test the API. If you don't have it installed, download it from [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- **API Server**: Ensure your API server is running locally.  Node.js framework, make sure it's up and running before testing.

## 1. Install Postman
To start testing, download and install Postman from the official site:  
[Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## 2. Start the API Server

Before you can test the API, ensure the server is running on your local machine. Depending on your setup, use the following commands:


## 3. Create and Send Requests in Postman

Open Postman and create a new request to interact with the API.

## GET Request Example:
**URL**     : http://localhost:5000/api/v1/your-endpoint
**Method**  : GET


## POST Request Example:
**URL**     : http://localhost:5000/api/v1/your-endpoint
**Method**  : POST
**Body**    : Select raw, then choose JSON format, and enter your data as follows:

{
  "key": "value"
}

## Note: Go through the following code to create a new request this is just a simple example of how to create a new request in Postman.


## Inspect the Response
After sending the request, Postman will display the API's response, including:

**Status code**      : Indicates whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
**Response body**    : The data returned by the API.
**Response headers** : Metadata related to the request and response.


## Save and Organize Requests
To make future testing more efficient, save your requests in Postman:

1. Click Save after sending a request.
2. Organize your requests into Collections for easy access and quick testing.

## Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰
